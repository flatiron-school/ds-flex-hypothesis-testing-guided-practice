## Overview

1. State the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$ or $H_1$)


2. Determine the correct test to perform.
    - What test is appropriate for your hypothesis?
    - What value should we use for $\alpha$? (e.g.: .05, .01,.001 ?)
    
    
3. Prepare the data and perform the selected test. 

4. Interpret the resulting p-value (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis) 

5. Perform posthoc tests (if necessary)

### STEP 1: State Your Hypothesis & Null Hypothesis 

- **Before selecting the correct hypothesis test, you must first officially state your null hypothesis ($H_0$) and alternative hypothesis ($H_A$ or $H_1$)**



- **Before stating your hypotheses, ask yourself:**
    1. What question am I attempting to answer?
    2. What metric/value am I measuring to answer this question?
    3. Do I expect the groups to be different in a specific way? (i.e. one group greater than the other).
        - Or do I just think they'll be different, but don't know how?


### STEP 2: Determine the correct test for the data/hypothesis

<!-- based on data type and # of samples/groups -->

#### Q1: What type of data am I measuring? Is it numeric or categorical?


#### Q2: How many groups/samples am I comparing?
- One group vs a known value?
- Two groups?
- More than two groups?


#### Using the answers to the above 2 questions: select the type of test from this table.

|*What type of comparison?* | Numeric Data | Categorical Data|
| --- | --- | --- |
|**1 Sample vs Known Quantity/Target**|1 Sample T-Test| Binomial Test|
|**2 Samples** | 2 Sample T-Test| Chi-Square|
|**More than 2**| ANOVA and/or Tukey | Chi Square|


#### What probability will we use as our significance cutoff?

- Set your $\alpha$ level (typically $\alpha$ =.05)
    - How rare should the value be before we consider it to be an outlier/statistically significantly different?

### STEP 3: Perform the test

#### Hypothesis Testing Functions

```python
from scipy import stats
```

| Hypothesis test|Scipy Function | 
 | --- | --- |
 | **1-sample t-test** |`stats.ttest_1samp()`|
 | **2-sample t-test** |`stats.ttest_ind()` | 
 | **One-Way ANOVA** | `stats.f_oneway()` | 
 | **Binomial test** |`stats.binom_test()` |
 | **Chi-Square test** | `stats.chi2_contingency()`|
 
 

- **Perform the test to get your test-statistic and the associated p-value.**

### STEP 4: Interpret the test result and perform any post-hoc test



#### Interpret your p-value compared to $\alpha$


- **If p > $\alpha$:**:
    - We fail to reject the null hypothesis.
        - The observed difference likely occurred due to random chance, not do to the effect we were analyzing.
        - We have essentially disproved our hypothesis.
    - The result is not significant.
    
    
- **If p is < $\alpha$:**
    - We reject the null hypothesis. 
        - The observed difference was most likely NOT due to random chance.
        - We have "supported" our hypothesis. (we NEVER "prove" our hypothesis)
    - The result is significant.

#### Next Steps 
- **If we did not have significant results:**
    - We are done! Write up the final answer. 
    
- **If we had significant results:**

    - If there are 2 groups:
        - Use a visualization to confirm which group had the larger/smaller value. (e.g. a barplot).
        - Calculate effect size (e.g. Cohen's $d$)
        - Write up the final answer.

    - If there are >2 groups:
        - Run a pairwise multiple-comparison test (e.g. Tukey's test) to determine which groups were different.
            - [Tukey pairwise comparison test](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.multicomp.pairwise_tukeyhsd.html) (`statsmodels.stats.multicomp.pairwise_tukeyhsd`)


- Report statistical power (optional)

#### Post-Hoc Functions:

| Post-Hoc Tests/Calculatons|Function|
|--- | --- |
|**Tukey's Pairwise Comparisons** | `statsmodels.stats.multicomp.pairwise_tukeyhsd`|
|**Effect Size**| `Cohens_d`|
|**Statistical Power** | `statsmodels.stats.power`:<br>  `TTestIndPower` , `TTestPower`

# Conclusion/Recap

- Today we walked through testing several hypothesis that required different statistical tests. 
- We walked through setting our hypothesis and null hypothesis.
- We then selected the right test based upon the type of data we were using and how many groups we were comparing. 

- We performed the chosen test, interpreted the p-value, and performed posthoc tests as needed.


- We learned that there are more advanced statistical tests than what is included in the curriculum.
